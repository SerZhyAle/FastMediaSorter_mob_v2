## 2.1. Repository Setup

### Step 1: Create a Remote Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
Click the "New" button to create a new repository.
In the "Repository name" field, enter FastMediaSorter_mobile.
Choose the repository type: "Private" (recommended to start).
Important: Do not initialize the repository with README, .gitignore, or license files, as the project already exists locally.
Click "Create repository".

### Step 2: Connect the Local Project to the Remote Repository
Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your project (c:\GIT\FastMediaSorter_mobile).
Link the local repository to the remote one using the command provided by GitHub on the next page after creating the repository. It will look like this:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/FastMediaSorter_mobile.git
```
Verify that the remote repository has been added successfully:
```
git remote -v
```
You should see two lines (for fetch and push) with your repository's URL.

### Step 3: Synchronize and Push the Source Code
It is recommended to rename the main branch to main if it is named master to comply with modern standards:
```
git branch -M main
```
Push the existing local commits to GitHub:
```
git push -u origin main
```
This command will upload your files and set origin/main as the upstream branch for your local main branch.

### Step 4: Configure the .gitignore File
The project already contains a .gitignore file. You need to ensure that it includes all standard exceptions for Android development with Kotlin to prevent system-generated, local, and temporary files from being committed to the repository.

Recommended content for .gitignore:

```
# Created by https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/android,kotlin,gradle

```

Replace the contents of your current .gitignore with the one suggested above for completeness.

### Step 5: Branch Protection
On your GitHub repository page, go to "Settings" > "Branches".
Click "Add branch protection rule".
In the "Branch name pattern" field, enter main.
Set the following flags to protect the branch:
- Require a pull request before merging: All changes must go through a Pull Request.
- Require status checks to pass before merging: Build and test checks are mandatory before merging (configured after setting up CI/CD).
- Require conversation resolution before merging: All comments in a Pull Request must be resolved.
Click "Create". This will establish a baseline for quality development practices.
