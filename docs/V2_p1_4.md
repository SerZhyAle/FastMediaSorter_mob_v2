## 1.4. Non-Functional Specification

### 1.4.1. Performance
*   **Interface Response Time:** Any operation lasting more than 1-2 seconds (e.g., file loading, copying, scanning) must display a progress indicator.
*   **Smooth Navigation:** To ensure fast media switching, the app must implement preemptive caching of the next file in the sequence.

### 1.4.2. Compatibility
*   **OS Versions:** The application must function correctly on Android 9.0 (API 28) and newer.
*   **Feature Adaptation:** For features incompatible with older supported OS versions, the app should provide graceful degradation or alternative implementations.
*   **System Theme:** The application must automatically adopt the device's current light or dark theme upon startup.

### 1.4.3. Reliability and Error Handling
*   **Robustness:** The app must handle file and network errors gracefully (e.g., unstable connection, no access, corrupted files).
*   **Logging Strategy:**
    *   **Release Builds:** Log critical errors only.
    *   **Debug Builds:** Log all operations to simplify debugging.
*   **Log Access:** Users must be able to access logs for the current session and a summary of the last 3 sessions (max 512 lines) via the settings menu.
*   **Detailed Errors:** An option in settings should allow users to see detailed error dialogs instead of brief pop-up messages.

### 1.4.4. Data Migration
*   **No Migration:** Version 2 is a new, standalone product. Migration of settings or data from v1 is not supported. Users will need to configure the app from scratch.

### 1.4.5. Publication Requirements
*   **Google Play:** The application must comply with all current Google Play Store policies for publication.
