## 3.2. Milestone Planning

This document defines the key development stages (milestones) for the project, allowing iterative progress and obtaining a working application version at each step.

### Milestone 1: Architectural Core and Basic UI
-   **Goal:** Create the application skeleton with configured architecture, navigation, and basic screens.
-   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Implement the project structure according to V2_architecture_overview.md (creating `core`, `data`, `domain`, `ui` packages).
    2.  Create base classes: `BaseActivity`, `BaseFragment`, `BaseViewModel`.
    3.  Set up Hilt for dependency injection.
    4.  Implement the main screen (`Main Screen`) with the ability to display an empty resource list.
    5.  Configure Navigation Component for basic navigation between the main screen and an empty settings screen.
-   **Result:** A working application template ready for functionality implementation.

### Milestone 2: Working with Local Files
-   **Goal:** Implement full functionality for managing media files from the device's local storage.
-   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Implement `UseCase` and `Repository` for adding, scanning, and editing local folder resources.
    2.  Implement `Browse Screen`: display media files from a local folder in list and grid view, basic sorting.
    3.  Implement `Player Screen`: view images and play video/audio from local storage.
    4.  Implement `Destinations`: configure destination folders from local ones.
    5.  Implement core file operations (copy, move, delete, rename) for local files.
-   **Result:** Fully functional application for sorting local media files.

### Milestone 3: Network Resources Integration (SMB and SFTP)
-   **Goal:** Extend the application functionality to work with network folders.
-   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Integrate `smbj` and `sshj` libraries.
    2.  Implement `UseCase` and `Repository` for adding and authenticating on SMB and SFTP resources.
    3.  Adapt `Browse Screen` and `Player Screen` for working with network files (download, streaming).
    4.  Ensure correct operation of file operations with network sources and destinations.
    5.  Implement "Test Connection" function for network resources.
-   **Result:** The application supports sorting files from both local and network sources.

### Milestone 4: Advanced Features and UI/UX
-   **Goal:** Implement complex logic specified in the specification and polish the user interface.
-   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Implement the undo last operation mechanism (`Undo`).
    2.  Implement all sorting and filtering modes on `Browse Screen`.
    3.  Fully implement the settings screen (`Settings Screen`) with all options.
    4.  Implement and configure `Welcome Screen`.
    5.  Finalize touch zones and command panels logic in `Player Screen`.
-   **Result:** Application with full feature set and polished user interface.

### Milestone 5: Cloud Storage Integration
-   **Goal:** Add support for cloud providers.
-   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Integrate Google Drive API: implement authentication, folder and file browsing.
    2.  Adapt file operations for Google Drive.
    3.  (Optional, depending on priorities) Repeat steps 1-2 for Microsoft Graph API (OneDrive) and Dropbox API.
-   **Result:** The application supports sorting files from cloud storage.

### Milestone 6: Release Candidate and Publication
-   **Goal:** Prepare and release a stable application version.
-   **Key Tasks:**
    1.  Conduct full regression testing of all features.
    2.  Perform performance profiling and bottleneck optimization.
    3.  Fix all discovered bugs.
    4.  Prepare Google Play materials (screenshots, icons, descriptions).
    5.  Build the final signed AAB version and publish it to Google Play Store via CI/CD.
-   **Result:** Version 2.0 published on Google Play.
