### The primary goals for v2.

#### Core Concept
*   **Unified Media Player:** The core of v2 is a single, integrated media player with robust sorting capabilities, eliminating the separation between slideshow and sorting modes.
*   **Supported Media:** The player will handle static images (JPEG, PNG), animations (GIF), video files (MP4, WEBM, etc.), and audio files (MP3, WAV).
*   **Intuitive UX:** The application must be simple and intuitive, anticipating user actions and providing guidance, especially during initial use.
*   **Combined Operations:** Users can browse, filter, and sort files within the same unified screen, and perform file operations (copy, move, delete, rename) directly from the player/browser view.
*   **Unified Resource List:** Local and network media folders (resources) are presented in a single, combined list.
*   **Dual View Modes:** The file browser will offer two display modes:
    *   **Grid View:** A table of media icons with a dynamic number of columns based on screen size.
    *   **List View:** A detailed, single-column list showing a small thumbnail and file information (name, size, date, etc.).
*   **Multi-Select:** Users can select multiple files in either view for batch operations.
*   **Advanced Sorting/Filtering:** Users can sort and filter the file list by various parameters like name, extension, size, creation date, and duration.
*   **UI Themes:** The app will support both light and dark system themes from the start.
*   **Optional Undo:** An "undo" feature for file operations will be available as an option.
*   **Pinch-to-Zoom:** Implement pinch-to-zoom for static images and videos.
*   **Streamlined Permissions:** Investigate methods to avoid repeated Android dialogs for file operations in already-approved local folders, possibly by requesting broader permissions upfront.

#### Problems the new UI/UX will solve compared to v1
*   **Reduces Confusion:** Eliminates the confusing separation between local and network folders by presenting them in a unified list.
*   **Simplifies Workflow:** Merges the "sorting" and "slideshow" functions into a single, cohesive player/browser interface.
*   **Enhances File Management:** Adds the much-needed ability to view, sort, and manage files in a list or grid view, which was absent in v1.
*   **Improves Stability:** Aims to fix the numerous errors and logical inconsistencies present in v1's Activity-to-Activity navigation.

#### Which features to keep, discard, or redesign
*   **Keep & Improve (Error Logging):** The comprehensive error collection and debugging data system from v1 must be retained and improved, combining full logging for debug builds and critical-only logging for release builds. The ability to export logs for the current session or the last 3 sessions (up to 512 lines) should be kept.
*   **Keep & Improve (Connection Test):** The "test connection" feature for new folders should be kept, providing status and brief info (access level, media counts).
*   **Keep (Multi-language Support):** Continue to support English, Russian, and Ukrainian, with the language defaulting to the system's setting (or English if unsupported) and allowing manual override.
*   **Keep (Touch Zone Controls):** The v1 concept of using screen touch zones (corners, sides) for navigation (next/previous) and rotation in the full-screen viewer is effective and should be retained.
*   **Keep (Dynamic Destination Buttons):** The v1 implementation of programmatically generated, colored buttons for copy/move destinations is efficient and should be kept to maximize screen real estate.
*   **Redesign (Welcome Screen):** A Welcome Screen is good, but the 7 pages from v1 are excessive. Condense the essential information into 3-5 pages.
*   **Keep (Pre-caching):** The mechanism for pre-caching the next media file in the sequence to ensure smooth playback in the player/slideshow mode should be preserved.
*   **Keep (Folder Scanning):** Retain the ability to scan local Android folders and network IPs for media. A folder should not be automatically removed from the app's lists if it's found to be empty during a rescan.
*   **Keep (ExoPlayer):** ExoPlayer remains a good choice for media playback. Error handling, especially for unstable network streams, must be robust. Confirm its capabilities for audio-only playback.
